# QuizJS 🧠⏳

QuizJS is an interactive, timed trivia application built using **Next.js** and **React**. Test your knowledge with dynamically generated questions from the Open Trivia Database, beat the 15-second clock, and track your high score!

## 🚀 Features

* **Dynamic Trivia:** Automatically fetches 10 random multiple-choice questions per game using the [Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB) API](https://opentdb.com/).
* **Difficulty Selection:** Tailor the challenge to your skill level by choosing between Easy, Medium, or Hard before starting a game.
* **Smart Answer Shuffling:** Question choices are dynamically shuffled every time they render so the correct answer is never in the same place twice.
* **Countdown Timer:** The pressure is on! You have exactly 15 seconds to answer each question.
* **Dedicated Game Screens:** Features clean UI transitions between the Initial Start screen, the active Quiz, and a "Congratulations!" Game Over screen.
* **Global State Management:** Utilizes the React Context API to efficiently pass score and timer data down the component tree.
* **HTML Parsing:** Safely renders complex HTML entities (like quotes and special characters) returned by the API for clean, readable text.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v16.1.6)
* **Library:** [React](https://react.dev/) (v19.2.3)
* **State Management:** React Context API
* **API:** [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)

## 🔮 Future Improvements
